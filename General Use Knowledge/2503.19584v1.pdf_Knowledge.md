## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Architectural Patterns
The system employs a master-slave pattern in its multi-agent architecture, where the master node handles core functions such as user interaction and task distribution, while worker nodes execute specific tasks. This separation of concerns allows for efficient task management and execution.

### Planner and Solver Models
The Planner model decomposes user queries into sub-tasks, leveraging context from multi-turn dialogues to plan task sequences. The Solver model focuses on parameter identification, extracting necessary values from dialogues to execute tasks accurately.

### Multi-turn Dialogue and Tool Invocation
The system enhances multi-turn dialogue capabilities through query rewriting and tool retrieval techniques. This allows the system to handle complex, multi-intent interactions seamlessly, improving task completion rates and reducing error rates in tool usage.

### Data Engineering
A robust data generation and annotation framework supports the system's learning processes. This includes a multi-turn data generation framework and a detailed annotation scheme to ensure high-quality training data for model development.
