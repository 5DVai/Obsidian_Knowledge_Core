**Source:** 2508.10745v1.pdf  
**Ingestion Date:** 2025-11-28

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces the Agentic Design Review System (Agentic-DRS), a pioneering framework for evaluating graphic designs. This system leverages multiple agents, each specializing in different aspects of design evaluation, orchestrated by a meta-agent. The framework aims to provide a holistic assessment of graphic designs by considering various dimensions such as alignment, color harmony, and typographic quality. The novel approach includes a graph-based exemplar selection method and a structured prompt expansion strategy to enhance the design awareness of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). The introduction of the DRS-BENCH benchmark suite further validates the efficacy of Agentic-DRS, showcasing its superiority over existing methods in generating actionable feedback for design improvements.

## Key Concepts & Principles
- **Agentic Framework:** A multi-agent system where each agent focuses on specific design attributes.
- **Graph-based Exemplar Selection:** A method that uses graph matching to select relevant design examples, preserving semantic and structural relationships.
- **Structured Design Description (SDD):** A technique to generate detailed textual descriptions of design elements, enhancing MLLM comprehension.
- **Meta-Agent Coordination:** A central agent that dynamically manages the evaluation process by spawning static and dynamic agents.
- **DRS-BENCH Benchmark:** A comprehensive suite for evaluating design quality across multiple attributes.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Agentic Framework
The Agentic-DRS employs a multi-agent system where each agent specializes in evaluating specific design attributes. Static agents assess fixed attributes like alignment and spacing, while dynamic agents adapt to context-specific attributes such as stylistic coherence. The meta-agent coordinates these agents, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation process.

### Graph-based Exemplar Selection
The GRAD method constructs graph representations of design elements, enabling structured retrieval of in-context design examples. This approach captures both semantic and spatial relationships, improving the selection of relevant exemplars for design evaluation.

### Structured Design Description
SDD generates hierarchical textual descriptions of design elements, providing a robust anchor for MLLM responses. This method enhances the understanding of design attributes and facilitates anomaly detection by combining visual perception with explicit structural details.

### Evaluation and Results
The introduction of the DRS-BENCH benchmark suite demonstrates the effectiveness of Agentic-DRS. The framework outperforms baseline methods across various metrics, showcasing its ability to generate actionable feedback and improve design quality.
