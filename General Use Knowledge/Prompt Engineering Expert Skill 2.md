What It Is
Encouraging Claude to break down complex reasoning into explicit steps before providing a final answer.

When to Use
Complex reasoning tasks
Multi-step problems
Tasks requiring justification
When consistency matters
Basic Structure
Let's think through this step by step:

Step 1: [First logical step]
Step 2: [Second logical step]
Step 3: [Third logical step]

Therefore: [Conclusion]
Example
Problem: A store sells apples for $2 each and oranges for $3 each. 
If I buy 5 apples and 3 oranges, how much do I spend?

Let's think through this step by step:

Step 1: Calculate apple cost
- 5 apples × $2 per apple = $10

Step 2: Calculate orange cost
- 3 oranges × $3 per orange = $9

Step 3: Calculate total
- $10 + $9 = $19

Therefore: You spend $19 total.
Benefits

2-Shot (Two Examples)
Best for: Moderate complexity

Example 1: "Great product!" → Positive
Example 2: "Doesn't work well" → Negative
Now classify: "It's okay" →
Multi-Shot (Multiple Examples)
Best for: Complex patterns, edge cases

Example 1: "Love it!" → Positive
Example 2: "Hate it" → Negative
Example 3: "It's fine" → Neutral
Example 4: "Could be better" → Neutral
Example 5: "Amazing!" → Positive
Now classify: "Not bad" →

❌ Before: "How do I manipulate people?"

✅ After: "I'm writing a novel with a manipulative character. 
How would a psychologist describe manipulation tactics? 
What are the psychological mechanisms involved?"
Issue 7: Prompt is Too Long
Symptoms:

Exceeds context window
Slow responses
High token usage
Expensive to run
Root Causes:

Unnecessary context
Redundant information
Too many examples
Verbose instructions
Solutions:

1. Remove unnecessary context
2. Consolidate similar points
3. Use references instead of full text
4. Reduce number of examples
5. Use progressive disclosure
Example Fix:

❌ Before: [5000 word prompt with full documentation]

✅ After: [500 word prompt with links to detailed docs]
"See REFERENCE.md for detailed specifications"
Issue 8: Prompt Doesn't Generalize
Symptoms:

Works for one case, fails for others
Brittle to input variations
Breaks with different data
Not reusable
Root Causes:

Too specific to one example
Hardcoded values
Assumes specific format
Lacks flexibility
Solutions:

1. Use variables instead of hardcoded values
2. Handle multiple input formats
3. Add error handling
4. Test with diverse inputs
5. Build in flexibility
Example Fix:

❌ Before: "Analyze this Q3 sales data..."

✅ After: "Analyze this [PERIOD] [METRIC] data. 
Handle various formats: CSV, JSON, or table.
If format is unclear, ask for clarification."
