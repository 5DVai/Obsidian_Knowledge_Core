12. Assessment & Pedagogical Notes (Blueprint Level)

You can later expand these into rubrics and grading schemes.

Formative Assessments:

Weekly/mid-module exercises (e.g., generate 3 thumbnail options, produce a 30-second short using AI VFX, draft a content calendar).

Summative Assessments:

Mid-course project: AI-assisted video with supporting documentation.

Final capstone campaign and portfolio presentation.

Evidence of Scholarly/Enterprise Rigor:

Explicit evaluation criteria: visual quality, narrative clarity, strategic alignment, ethical compliance, and metric-driven iteration.

Reflection components connecting practice to broader media, AI ethics, and business literature.

This blueprint should give you enough structure to:

Turn each topic into a lesson with objectives, readings, and activities.

Align assessments to outcomes (e.g., using Bloom’s taxonomies: apply, analyze, create).

Scale the program from a 2-day intensive (condense modules) to a multi-week cohort (expand modules and project time).
