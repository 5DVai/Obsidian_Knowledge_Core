**Ingestion Date:** 2025-11-28

## Executive Summary
The document presents a comprehensive catalogue of architectural patterns specifically designed for foundation model-based agents. These agents leverage advanced reasoning and language processing capabilities to autonomously pursue user-defined goals. The catalogue addresses the challenges faced in designing such agents, including goal-seeking, plan generation, and managing the inherent uncertainties of foundation models. By systematically reviewing existing literature, the authors have identified 17 architectural patterns that provide reusable solutions to common design problems in this domain.

The value of this catalogue lies in its ability to guide software architects and developers in effectively designing and implementing foundation model-based agents. The patterns cover a wide range of aspects, from goal creation and plan generation to cooperation schemes and reflection mechanisms. Each pattern is analyzed in terms of its context, forces, trade-offs, and real-world applications, offering a holistic view of the design space for these agents.

## Key Concepts & Principles
- **Foundation Models (FMs):** Large-scale models with capabilities in reasoning and language processing.
- **Architectural Patterns:** Reusable solutions to common design problems in software architecture.
- **Goal-Seeking:** The process of deriving and pursuing user-defined objectives.
- **Plan Generation:** Decomposing goals into executable tasks and orchestrating their execution.
- **Reflection Mechanisms:** Techniques for agents to evaluate and refine their reasoning processes.
- **Cooperation Schemes:** Methods for coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks.

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### Architectural Patterns Overview
The document identifies 17 architectural patterns, each addressing specific challenges in the design of foundation model-based agents. These patterns include:

- **Passive and Proactive Goal Creators:** Techniques for understanding user goals through dialogue interfaces and environmental context.
- **Prompt/Response Optimiser:** Standardizing inputs and outputs to align with user goals and system interoperability.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhancing agent knowledge with external data sources while maintaining privacy.
- **Model Querying Techniques:** Strategies for interacting with foundation models, including one-shot and incremental querying.
- **Plan Generators:** Single-path and multi-path approaches for creating coherent and efficient plans.
- **Reflection Patterns:** Self-reflection, cross-reflection, and human reflection for iterative plan refinement.
- **Cooperation Schemes:** Voting-based, role-based, and debate-based methods for agent collaboration.
- **Guardrails and Registries:** Ensuring safety and discoverability of tools and agents.

### Comparison of Patterns
- **Goal Creators:** Passive goal creators rely on user input, while proactive goal creators incorporate environmental context for a more comprehensive understanding.
- **Plan Generators:** Single-path generators focus on efficiency and coherence, whereas multi-path generators offer flexibility and alignment with user preferences.
- **Reflection Mechanisms:** Self-reflection is efficient but limited by the agent's capabilities, while cross-reflection and human reflection provide external validation and alignment with human values.
