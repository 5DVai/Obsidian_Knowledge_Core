How to Speak – Knowledge Bible

Based on Patrick Winston’s “How to Speak”

1. Core Thesis

Your success in life is driven largely by:

Your ability to speak.

Your ability to write.

The quality of your ideas.
In that order.

Communication skill is mostly:

Knowledge (K): what you know about how to speak.

Practice (P): how much you use and refine that knowledge.

Talent (T): innate ability, which is relatively small.

Therefore:

You can outperform naturally gifted speakers by acquiring more techniques (K) and applying deliberate practice (P).

Treat speaking as a weapon/tool you must not enter “battle” without.

Meta-goal:

Build your own repertoire of techniques.

Observe great speakers, ask “why does this work?”, and copy what fits your style.

2. Rule of Engagement: Attention

Humans effectively have one language processor:

If it’s reading email/web, it’s not listening to you.

Multitasking in language is an illusion.

For both you and your audience, protect attention:

Ban laptops and phones in serious talks when possible.

Visible device use:

Distracts the user.

Distracts everyone around them.

Distracts the speaker (and degrades performance).

Principle:

Attention is finite. Guard it ruthlessly.

3. How to Start a Talk
3.1. Do NOT open with a joke

At the very beginning:

People are still settling in.

They’re adapting to your voice, speed, accent, and presence.

They may be putting things away or arriving mentally.

A joke in this phase:

Often falls flat.

Wastes the “setup” moment.

3.2. Start with an Empowerment Promise

Define what the audience will be able to do/know at the end that they couldn’t at the start.

Features of a good empowerment promise:

Specific: not “you’ll learn something”, but “you will know how to X”.

Desirable: clearly valuable to them.

Time-bound: “by the end of this hour / talk / section”.

Example structure:

“By the end of this talk, you’ll know:

A set of techniques for <topic>.

How to avoid the most common failure patterns.

At least one idea that could materially change your results.”

Secondary benefit:

Forces you to decide what the talk is actually for.

4. Four Core Delivery Heuristics (“Bus Re-entry Heuristics”)

These are techniques to help people “get back on the bus” after they drift.

4.1. Cycling: Say the Important Things Multiple Times

Reality:

At any given moment, a fraction of the audience is mentally fogged out.

Strategy:

“Cycle around” your key idea 2–3 times:

First pass: intuitive overview.

Second pass: more precise with structure.

Third pass: example or alternative framing.

Purpose:

Increases probability that everyone hears and understands the essentials at least once.

4.2. Fencing: Define What Your Idea Is and Is NOT

Build a conceptual fence around your idea:

Show positive examples: “This is X.”

Show near-misses and non-examples: “This is NOT X.”

Use contrast:

“This algorithm may look like Jones’s, but his is exponential and ours is linear.”

“This structure is an arch; these look similar, but they fail the defining property.”

Purpose:

Prevent confusion with similar concepts.

Position your idea clearly within the landscape of related ideas.

4.3. Verbal Punctuation: Signposting and Structure

People need landmarks to reorient:

Explicit outline: “First, we’ll cover…, then…, finally…”

Enumeration: “Now we’re on point three.”

Section markers: “We’ve finished tools; now let’s discuss special cases.”

Practical tactics:

Show a simple agenda early.

Periodically refer back: “We’ve done 1 and 2; now we’re on 3.”

Use verbal seams: “That wraps up X. Next is Y.”

Purpose:

Lets people know where they are and when it’s safe to re-engage after drifting.

4.4. Questions: Use Silence Deliberately

Ask the audience questions:

To re-engage them.

To check understanding.

To change the rhythm.

Key technique:

After asking, wait.

You can wait up to ~7 seconds; it will feel long to you, but it’s normal.

Designing questions:

Not too trivial (people feel foolish answering).

Not too hard (no one answers).

Aim for “answerable with some thought.”

Purpose:

Creates participation.

Signals “now is a good time to get back on the bus.”

5. Time and Place
5.1. When to Speak

Ideal lecture times (for students / knowledge work audiences):

Late morning (e.g., ~11 AM):

People are awake but not yet fatigued.

Not straight after a heavy meal.

Avoid:

Very early morning (people groggy).

Right after meals (post-lunch dip).

Late night (fatigue).

5.2. Where to Speak

Lighting

Room should be well lit.

Dark rooms signal “sleep” to the brain.

If AV staff want lights down “for the slides”, push back:

People can’t see slides through closed eyelids.

Case the Room

Visit the room before your talk.

Check:

Where you will stand.

Board/screen visibility.

Mic and AV equipment.

Strange layouts or obstacles.

Purpose:

Avoid surprises.

Adjust your approach to the physical constraints.

Audience Density

The room should be at least half full.

Too large and mostly empty:

Feels like your event is unimportant.

Audience wonders “what better thing is happening elsewhere?”

Mental trick:

When rehearsing in an empty room, imagine it filled with indifferent farm animals.

Real audience will feel easier by comparison.

6. Tools of the Trade: Boards, Props, and Slides
6.1. Boards (Chalkboards/Whiteboards)

Use boards when your goal is informing/teaching.

Advantages:

Graphic Quality

Easy to draw diagrams, arrows, spatial relationships.

Visual structure emerges gradually.

Speed Matching

Writing speed ≈ audience absorption speed.

Prevents “slide flipping” too fast for comprehension.

Hand Management

Novice speakers often don’t know what to do with their hands:

Stuff hands in pockets.

Put them behind their back (which can signal concealment or disrespect in some cultures).

A board gives your hands a purpose:

Writing.

Underlining.

Pointing.

Empathetic Mirroring

When the audience watches you draw/write or manipulate real objects, mirror neurons fire.

They mentally simulate the action.

This increases engagement and retention compared to static slides.

6.2. Props

Think like a playwright:

Props can:

Foreshadow events.

Anchor key concepts in memory.

Create emotional or cognitive tension.

Use props to:

Make abstract ideas concrete (e.g., bicycle wheel for gyroscopic force).

Force rethinking of a problem (e.g., duct tape on one part of the wheel to focus attention).

Demonstrate principles (e.g., pendulum ball near the face to dramatize conservation of energy).

Properties of effective props:

Visible to the whole audience.

Used repeatedly through the talk, not just once.

Tied clearly to the key idea.

Why they work:

Combine physical movement, visual cues, and narrative tension.

Those scenes become what people remember years later.

6.3. Slides
6.3.1. Primary Purpose

Slides are best for exposing ideas (e.g., job talks, conference talks), not for detailed teaching.

6.3.2. Common Crimes

Too Many Slides

Almost everyone uses too many.

Too Many Words

People read the slide and stop listening.

Remember: one language processor — reading competes with listening.

Reading the Slides Aloud

Insults the audience’s literacy.

Makes your presence redundant.

Small Fonts

Tools encourage shrinking text to fit more content.

Don’t do it:

Minimum comfortable size often around ~40–50 pt for big rooms.

If you need smaller fonts, you’re cramming too much on the slide.

Visual Clutter

Busy backgrounds.

Logos on every slide.

Gratuitous bullets and lines.

Distance Between You and Slides

Standing far away from the screen and forcing audience to “tennis match” between you and the projected content.

Laser Pointer Abuse

Forces you to turn your back to the audience.

Loses eye contact and connection.

Produces distracting motion.

Heavy Slides

Wall-of-text slides with minimal white space or imagery.

Hard to parse and exhausting.

Slide Deck Bloat

Dozens of slides deep into the talk (e.g., slide 80) with more to come.

Long lists of conclusions or “10 concluding slides” kill attention.

6.3.3. Good Slide Practice

Simplify ruthlessly:

Remove decorative backgrounds.

Remove logos (except maybe on title slide).

Remove unnecessary titles when you’re already stating them verbally.

Minimal text:

Use short phrases.

Let spoken words carry the narrative.

Treat slides as condiments, not the main dish.

Font size as throttle:

Keep fonts large to force brevity.

Replace laser pointers:

Embed arrows or labels directly on the slide.

Then you can say: “Look at the point labeled (1).”

Allow “hapax” slides sparingly:

One “complex” slide per talk (e.g., a dense diagram) may be acceptable when the whole point is its complexity.

Use once (per talk/paper/book) and explain why it’s there.

Print-and-lay-out test:

Print all slides.

Lay them on a table.

If most pages are dark with text and little white space, your deck is too heavy.

7. Modes of Speaking: Inform, Inspire, Persuade
7.1. Informing / Teaching

Start with:

An empowerment promise.

A sense of why the topic is exciting or important.

Inspire by:

Showing dramatic contrasts (e.g., an algorithm that would take longer than the age of the solar system vs one that runs in seconds).

Expressing genuine passion for the subject.

Teaching people “how to think”:

Humans are story-driven.

Thinking is organizing, comparing, and critiquing stories.

To teach thinking:

Provide high-quality stories (cases, examples).

Offer questions to ask about those stories.

Show methods for analyzing and evaluating them.

Show how to combine stories into models and frameworks.

7.2. Persuading: Oral Exams

Two major failure modes:

Failure to situate.

Failure to practice.

Situating:

Place your work in context:

Why the problem matters.

How long it has been open.

Why solving it has impact.

How your contribution fits with global efforts.

Practicing:

Don’t rehearse only with people who already know your work.

They will “hallucinate” missing content because they know the backstory.

Instead:

Practice with smart but uninformed friends.

Ask them to be brutally honest: “If you can’t make me cry, you’re not helping me.”

Committee composition:

Younger examiners may be more aggressively critical as they try to prove themselves.

Senior examiners may be more measured and contextual.

When possible, aim for a committee with more experienced members.

7.3. Persuading: Job Talks

Two things you must establish within ~5 minutes:

You have vision.

You have done something.

Vision:

Define an important problem people care about.

Show that your approach is new or distinctive.

Example pattern:

“The big problem is __. Many people care because __.
My approach is __, which differs from prior work by __.”

Showing you’ve done something:

List the steps needed to solve the problem.

Mark which ones you have already completed.

Pattern:

“To solve this, we must:

Specify the behavior or phenomenon precisely.

Identify constraints or principles that make it tractable.

Build and test a system or model.

Evaluate its performance or implications.

We have completed steps 1–3 and will show you the system today.”

Structure (“sandwich” model):

Beginning: problem, vision, and roadmap/steps.

Middle: details and evidence.

End: contributions mirroring the initial steps:

“We contributed:

A formal specification of __.

A constraint framework for __.

An implemented system that __.

An evaluation showing __.”

7.4. Getting Known / Recognized

Why care?

People rarely get used to being ignored.

You want your ideas to be recognized and taken seriously.

Your ideas are like your children:

You don’t want them going out into the world poorly dressed.

Speaking is the act of dressing your ideas in respectable clothing.

8. Winston’s Star: Making Work Memorable

A 5-part framework; each element starts with S.

Symbol

A simple, visual anchor (e.g., an arch).

Something people can picture easily.

Slogan

A short phrase that labels your idea (e.g., “one-shot learning”).

Acts as a handle for memory and discussion.

Surprise

A result that violates naive expectations (e.g., “You don’t need millions of examples; one can suffice if you use it wisely.”).

People remember surprises.

Salient Idea

Not “important” but “stands out.”

A concept that is clearly central (e.g., “near miss” as a key learning mechanism).

Avoid packing too many equally-strong ideas into one work; pick one that sticks.

Story

A narrative:

How the problem arose.

What you tried.

How you solved it.

Why it matters.

Humans remember stories far better than abstract lists.

Use Winston’s Star when crafting papers, talks, and research programs to increase their memorability.

9. How to End a Talk
9.1. Final Slide

Do not end with:

A long list of collaborators.

A gigantic reference slide.

“Thank you” written alone.

Your email/URL as a big lonely slide.

Place collaborators:

Recognize them on the first slide:

Names, affiliations, funding acknowledgments.

Avoid making the last message “I only did 1/1000th of this”.

Best practice:

Final slide = Contributions.

Label it “Contributions”, not “Conclusions”.

Keep it visible during Q&A and as people leave.

Contributions slide structure:

Bullet points summarizing what you did:

“We introduced __.”

“We proved __.”

“We built __.”

“We demonstrated __.”

9.2. Final Words

Ending with “Thank you”:

Common but weak.

Implies people stayed merely out of politeness.

You won’t be punished for it, but you miss an opportunity.

Alternatives:

Joke (At the End)

By the end, people are tuned to your style.

A closing joke can leave them with a sense of having enjoyed the entire talk.

Benediction

A formulaic blessing or closing (“God bless you, and God bless ___”).

Works in political or ceremonial contexts; adapt to your setting.

Convention

Use signals your audience knows mark the end (similar to “Ite missa est” in Mass or a conductor shaking hands with the concertmaster).

Salute the Audience

Express genuine appreciation for them and the environment:

“It’s been stimulating to be here.”

“Your questions have been provocative and helpful.”

“I’d be glad to continue the conversation in the future.”

Principle:

The last words should reinforce your authority and connection, not apologize for taking their time.

10. Quick Operational Checklists
10.1. Before the Talk

 Clarify your empowerment promise.

 Decide if your goal is informing, inspiring, or persuading (oral exam, job talk, pitch).

 Design:

 A clear outline with 3–5 sections.

 At least one symbol/story for Winston’s Star.

 Choose tools:

 Board/props if teaching.

 Slides (minimal) if exposing or pitching.

 Build slides with:

 Large fonts.

 Minimal text.

 No unnecessary logos/backgrounds.

 Embedded arrows instead of relying on a laser pointer.

 Visit or visualize the room:

 Check lighting, AV, seating.

 Plan where you’ll stand and move.

 Arrange practice:

 Run through the talk with people unfamiliar with your work.

 Invite ruthless feedback.

10.2. During the Talk

 Start with:

 Rule of engagement (if needed): devices closed.

 Empowerment promise.

 Use the four bus heuristics:

 Cycle key ideas several times.

 Fence your idea against alternatives and confusions.

 Use verbal punctuation to signal transitions.

 Ask questions, wait in silence for answers.

 Maintain:

 Eye contact (don’t face the slides).

 Natural hand use (board, pointing, props).

 If using slides:

 Do not read them aloud.

 Speak around the bullet phrases, not through them.

 Pause when a text-heavy slide is necessary to let people read.

10.3. Ending the Talk

 Last slide is Contributions, not “Thank you” or contact info.

 Final words:

 Optionally a joke.

 Or a short benediction.

 Or a salute to the audience and venue.

 Leave contributions slide up during Q&A.

 Avoid making your literal last word “thank you” (you can still mouth it during applause).

This Bible gives you a compact but deep framework for speaking drawn from the transcript: why speaking matters, how to structure a talk, how to use tools and rooms, how to persuade in high-stakes settings, and how to be remembered. You can now treat each section as a module to practice and refine into your own style.
