## Public Accessibility Check (Verifier-Independent)

**Purpose**: Ensure the repo is actually publicly accessible from a signed-out client, not just pushable via authenticated token.

### Required Checks

1. **Owner Profile Visibility**
   - The repo must appear in the public repositories list at: https://github.com/5DVai
   - Verification: Open owner profile page (signed-out) and confirm repo is listed

2. **Repo Homepage Accessibility**
   - Opening the repo homepage must not return 404 (from a signed-out client)
   - Verification: https://github.com/5DVai/Obsidian_Knowledge_Core should load without authentication

3. **Raw URL Accessibility**
   - Raw URLs must be reachable without authentication:
     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5DVai/Obsidian_Knowledge_Core/main/Research/Indexes/Handshake_Log.md
     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5DVai/Obsidian_Knowledge_Core/main/Research/Indexes/Public_Proof.md
   - Verification: Open raw URLs in incognito/private browser window

**Status**: If any of these checks fail, the repo is effectively still private (or under a different owner/name than reported), even if pushes succeed via an authenticated token.

**Note**: This file is updated on each verification task to provide machine-checkable public URLs. All URLs must be verifiable from a signed-out client to close the 3-way verification loop.
