# MDN Web Docs

## Overview

MDN Web Docs (formerly Mozilla Developer Network) is the authoritative, open-source documentation for web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs. Maintained by Mozilla and the web community since 2005, it serves as the primary reference for web developers worldwide.

## Key Content Areas

- **HTML**: Markup language reference, elements, attributes, guides
- **CSS**: Styling reference, properties, selectors, layout guides
- **JavaScript**: Language reference, APIs, guides, best practices
- **Web APIs**: Browser APIs, DOM, Fetch, Service Workers, etc.
- **Learn Web Development**: Structured learning paths for beginners
- **Tools**: Interactive playgrounds, generators, validators

## When to Use

- Looking up web standard specifications and browser compatibility
- Understanding HTML elements, CSS properties, or JavaScript APIs
- Learning web development fundamentals
- Checking browser support for features
- Finding code examples and interactive demos
- Reference for web standards compliance

## Failure Modes

- Some advanced or experimental features may have incomplete documentation
- Community-contributed content may occasionally have inaccuracies (though actively maintained)
- May not always reflect the absolute latest browser implementations
- Focus is on standards-compliant code, not framework-specific patterns

## Notable Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Documents HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs extensively
- **Browser Compatibility Tables**: Shows support across major browsers
- **Interactive Examples**: Code examples with live previews
- **Multilingual**: Available in multiple languages
- **Open Source**: Community-driven, editable on GitHub
- **Standards-Focused**: Aligned with W3C and WHATWG specifications
